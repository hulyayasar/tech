	/*
	 1) if you change the body of a method which is in parent class when you use it in child class,
	   it means you are "overriding the method".
	   
	 2)When you override a method if you need you can change the return type and access modifier, it is accepted
	   overriding BUT you CANNOT change the Method Signature(method name and the parameters).
	   
	 3)if you use "@Override" annotation before the overriding method, Java will check if the Overriding is done
	   correctly or not
	   
	 4)The method which is overridden from parent class is called "Overridden Method"
       When you override the method which is created in Child class is called
       "Overriding Method"
       
     5)Overriding is done so that the child class can give its own implementation 
       to the method which is provided by the parent class. 
       
     6)We can use different "access modifiers" for "Overridden" and "Overriding"
       methods.But "Overriding" method's access modifier should be same or wider than
       "Overridden" method's access modifier. 
       
     7)We can use different “return types” for “Overridden” and “Overriding”
	  methods. But the return type of “Overriding” method should be same or smaller then the 
	  return type of “Overridden” method.
	  
	 8)if you are using primitives as return type in overriding, you CANNOT use different return types for
	  “Overridden” and “Overriding” methods.
	  
	9)If you are using Wrapper Classes as return type in overriding, you CANNOT use different return types for
	  “Overridden” and “Overriding” methods. Because, there is no parent child relationship between Wrapper Classes
	  As a conclusion; In overriding, “Overriding” method can use the same return type with the “Overridden” method
	          or can use child classes as return type. 
	          In Overriding, you should have “IS-A” relationship from
	          “Overriding” method to “Overridden” method for return types.
